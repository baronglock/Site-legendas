Hi, I'm David Spuddle and I'm making this

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.500
video because I want to know.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.140
Do you know how to do wing overs?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.860
Do you know that after full stall spin

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.920
and spiral exits, this maneuver is the

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.460
most important

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.420
of all if you want to begin acrobatics?

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.560
The understanding and mastery of this

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.680
basic maneuver will later help you with

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.140
loopings,

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.200
tumbling, corkscrews, and mac twist,

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.340
infinities and more.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.100
Do you know how to do it properly?

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.620
Do you understand the dynamics behind it?

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.520
Are you able to make more than five

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.520
perfect ones in a row?

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.920
If not, would you be interested in a

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.880
video where I would explain you how to

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.480
approach it at

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.120
the beginning, how to mentally prepare

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.640
for it?

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.160
What are the safety reflexes, material

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.440
and thoughts you need to begin?

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.880
What are the dynamics behind it, and how

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.600
its mastery will accelerate your acro

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.000
progression?

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.780
If you need such a video, let me know by

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.600
posting in the comments below and I will

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.860
prepare

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.100
the most exhaustive video material on

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.960
wing overs you will have ever seen in

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.380
your lifetime.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.900
Now let me show you how I do perfect wing

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.100
overs.
