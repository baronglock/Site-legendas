Hi, I'm David Spuddle and I'm making this

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,500
video because I want to know.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,140
Do you know how to do wing overs?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,860
Do you know that after full stall spin

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,920
and spiral exits, this maneuver is the

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,460
most important

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,420
of all if you want to begin acrobatics?

8
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,560
The understanding and mastery of this

9
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,680
basic maneuver will later help you with

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,140
loopings,

11
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,200
tumbling, corkscrews, and mac twist,

12
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,340
infinities and more.

13
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,100
Do you know how to do it properly?

14
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,620
Do you understand the dynamics behind it?

15
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,520
Are you able to make more than five

16
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,520
perfect ones in a row?

17
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,920
If not, would you be interested in a

18
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,880
video where I would explain you how to

19
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,480
approach it at

20
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,120
the beginning, how to mentally prepare

21
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:36,640
for it?

22
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,160
What are the safety reflexes, material

23
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,440
and thoughts you need to begin?

24
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,880
What are the dynamics behind it, and how

25
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,600
its mastery will accelerate your acro

26
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,000
progression?

27
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,780
If you need such a video, let me know by

28
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,600
posting in the comments below and I will

29
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:49,860
prepare

30
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,100
the most exhaustive video material on

31
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,960
wing overs you will have ever seen in

32
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,380
your lifetime.

33
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,900
Now let me show you how I do perfect wing

34
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,100
overs.
